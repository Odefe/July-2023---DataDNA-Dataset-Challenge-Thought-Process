I decided to concentrate on the repeated guests. 
Why do they keep coming back?
Who are they?
What do they like?

I filtered the entire excel sheet to show me only when a guest is repeated.
When the value of is repeeated is one.
Copied entire filtered section and put it in its own sheet for further analysis.
Created a table.
Then a Pivot Table in a new sheet.
I checked which hotel they prefer..
It doesn't matter if it's sum or count because they both start from 1
53% to City Hotel so not much diffrence.

I wanted to calculate if having children and babies affect repeat visits.
I needed to create a formula to know how many adults are with no children or babies.
This was that formula: =IF(AND(J10>0,K10=0,L10=0),"Adult with Children","Adult with no kids")
So 3.3% of adults with kids repeat & 1.5% of adults without kids come back.
It wasn't worth reporting. Didn't visualize it

I decided to visualize which meal plan repeat guests enjoy the most
Created a pivot table.
Put the meal in rows and the repeated guest in values.
I used sum because it will start from 1 and add all the repeated guests.
SC & UNdefined both meant no meal package so i joined them together and named them that

I wanted to see what time of the month repeat guest come the most.
So i put arrival_date_month & arrival_date_year in the values of my pivot table.
then i put count of arrival_date_month & arrival_date_year in the values column. 
It gave me the same information when i plotted the chart so i removed on of the count from the value.

Created a dashboard from the charts i had.
Added some information where space was available.
